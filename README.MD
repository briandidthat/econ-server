# Financial Server
Financial statistics application powered by Coinbase, FRED, and Twelve Data's API.

The original intent was to make a demo app to showcase multithreaded requests in Spring Boot and CI/CD in CircleCi. 
Shortly after, I figured I should just make it useful and included other useful financial information.
